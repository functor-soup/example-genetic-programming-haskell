Haskell rework of genetic-algorithm contained in Chaper 11 `Evolving Intelligence` in the book 
[Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications by Toby Segaran](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325)
Do buy the book, it is a wonderful book. 

## Differences from the book version
1. Written in Haskell
2. No logic or comparisons are included, evolved solutions have arithmetic operations as part of their encoded solutions


## Future Improvements
1. Refactor Evolve.hs
2. General refactoring
