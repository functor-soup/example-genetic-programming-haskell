## Attempt at a very very non-general version version of a genetic algorithm

Inspired by the Genetic programming stuff in `Programming Collective Intelligence`
The code is very messy .. but I'm trying to get it done all nicely in a iterative approach (hehe)
But getting to reuse the random generator all the way down was fun and hectic and frustrating and awesome!!!


HASKELL FTW!!!!!!

## Note
The final generation are not satisfactory solutions at all!!! It needs more work
